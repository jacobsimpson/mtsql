# mtsql

An SQL engine for reading data from CSV files.

You probably shouldn't use this. It is intended more as a mechanism for
exploring how SQL database engines are implemented rather than a coherent set
of functionality. See [csvq](https://github.com/mithrandie/csvq) for a fully
developed tool for querying CSV files.

It provides the ability to `SELECT` from a CSV file.
